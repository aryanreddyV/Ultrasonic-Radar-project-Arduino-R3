Working principles:::
1.Rotating & scanning---A servo motor rotates the sensor in a predefined angle range (e.g., 0° to 180°).
                        Distance data is collected at each angle to map the surroundings.

2.Data visualization---The Arduino sends the distance and angle data to a computer via serial communication from laptop by USB cable to UNO R3
                       The data is displayed on a radar-like interface, showing the positions of detected objects.

This Ultrasonic Radar technology is used in various industries like:-
-Robotics & Autonomous vehincles-for obtacle detection
-Industrial automation-for proximity sensing and level measurement
-Automotive safety systems-for parking assitance & anti-collision systems
-Environmental monitoring & Process control-for measuring liquid levels and flow rates
