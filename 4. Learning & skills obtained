-----------[Learning:::]-----------
I have learned how to make an Ultrasonic Radar system by using components of Arduino uno R3, Ultrasonic sensor HC SR04, Servo motor,
Breadboard and jumper wires...
I learnt its process & uses in real life...
I have learnt how to debugging hardware &  debugging software by modifying the code.



-----------[ Skills Acquired from the Ultrasonic Radar Project:::]-----------

## Technical Skills 
Here are the specific technical skills I developed or enhanced during this project:

1. Physical Computing:** Learned how to bridge the gap between software instructions and physical hardware movements using an Arduino board.
2. Electronics Wiring & Prototyping:** Gained hands-on experience using a breadboard to manage connections safely and efficiently. I learned
                                          how to correctly connect VCC (power), GND (ground), and signal pins for sensors and motors.
3. Microcontroller Programming (Arduino/C++):** Modified and uploaded C++ code to control an SG90 servo motor (for movement) and an HC-SR04
                                                   ultrasonic sensor (for distance readings).
4. Serial Communication:** Set up data transfer between the Arduino board and my laptop's software (Processing IDE) via a USB COM port.
5. Graphical Programming (Processing IDE):** Customized a Java-based Processing sketch to display data graphically and personalize the 
                                                output (adding my name display).
6. Version Control (Git/GitHub):** Documented the entire build process and uploaded all code to a GitHub repository, practicing 
                                      industry-standard documentation habits.

## Problem-Solving Skills 
Building this project required independent troubleshooting and learning how to overcome unexpected errors:

1. Debugging Hardware:** Figured out how to connect male-to-male wires to female sockets and a breadboard, ensuring every component had
                         power and ground.
2. Debugging Software/Connectivity:** Independently resolved the `Access is denied` COM port error by ensuring only one program 
                                      (either Arduino IDE for uploading or Processing IDE for running) accessed the port at a time.
3. Independent Initiative:** Successfully built and customized the project from start to finish with minimal external guidance, demonstrating 
                                resourcefulness.
