# Ultrasonic-Radar-project-Arduino-R3
A repository of mine which is about the making of Ultrasonic Radar project from scratch to the refinements...
credit: @Techie_Siddh ---from youtube--- I have learnt the making of this project from him.
I have taken the code from him and made some changes. There is a seperate file for crediting him in this repository.
->I have learnt about this project and it's purposes and processes from scratch.
->I have achieved success by making this project from virtually to reality.

*This project involves creating a functional radar system using an ultrasonic sensor, Arduino Uno, and a breadboard.
he radar is capable of detecting objects within a specified range and displaying their positions on a graphical interface.
They are commonly used in robotics, industrial automation, object detection, distance measurement, and obstacle avoidance systems
It is a cost-effective way to learn about radar technology and its basic principles.*

This repository includes the:-
1. Hardware components used
2. Methodology
3. Arduino IDE code
4. Processing IDE code
